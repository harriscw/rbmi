\title{A collection of \code{imputation_singles()} grouped by a single subjid ID}
\usage{
imputation_list_single(imputations, D = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{imputations}{a list of \code{\link[=imputation_single]{imputation_single()}} objects ordered so that repetitions
are grouped sequentially}

\item{D}{the number of repetitions that were performed which determines how many columns
the imputation matrix should have

This is a constructor function to create a \code{imputation_list_single} object
which contains a matrix of \code{\link[=imputation_single]{imputation_single()}} objects grouped by a single \code{id}. The matrix
is split so that it has D columns (i.e. for non-bmlmi methods this will always be 1)

The \code{id} attribute is deterimined by extracting the \code{id} attribute from the contributing
\code{\link[=imputation_single]{imputation_single()}} objects. An error is throw if multiple \code{id} are detected}
